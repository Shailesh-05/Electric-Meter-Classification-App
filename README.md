# Image-Classification-Electric-Meter-Images
Built a custom deep learning model to classify two sets of meter & non-meter images using CNN in Tensorflow (GPU). Employed Dropouts and L2 Regularization for better performance on the test set and avoid overfitting over training data. Used Minibatch Gradient Descent for better training and achieved 93.2% Training and 94.1% Test Accuracy, which 
improved to 96.6% with InceptionV3 Model.
