# Image-Classification-Electric-Meter-Images
Created and Deployed a Flask App for Electric Meter Classification.Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python applications.
Firstly,Built a custom deep learning model to classify two sets of meter & non-meter images using CNN in Tensorflow (GPU). 
Employed Dropouts and L2 Regularization for better performance on the test set and avoid overfitting over training data.
Used Minibatch Gradient Descent for better training and achieved 77.2% Training and 83.1% Test Accuracy, which improved to 93.1% with InceptionV3 Model. 
Finally, Created & Deployed an App successfully for Electric Meter Classification using Flask.
